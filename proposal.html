								<h2>Proposal - What Leads to Genocide?</h2>
								<p>I propose to research the steps a people must take before becoming comfortable or capable of committing the atrocious that happen during genocide. I am interested in how current events and mindsets can twist regular people into monsters capable of doing such things. Before every genocide there are things that must happen leading up to it, and finding those steps is what I intend to research. I will look at the countryâ€™s economic situation, social tensions, current events, stability, and the outlook the country has on their future. This topic is interesting because it is important to understand what the steps leading to genocide are, so we can correctly predict and prevent it from happening again.</p>
