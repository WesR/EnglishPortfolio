								<p>Genocide is a touchy subject. In society, most countries and societies are willing to recognize what has passed, but some are still in denial of the most widely known and factually supported genocides, like the Holocaust, or Armenian. Putting aside the fact that some countries outright deny the mere existence of genocide whether committed by them or not, we are left with countries that gloss over the in-depth facts of this horrible atrocity. To better understand what makes a genocide happen, to understand what drives a people to kill of their neighbor, we must look deeper into what has happened before us. By understanding what leads people to committing these crimes, we can prevent genocide from happening before it even becomes a threat.</p>
								<p>Even though not all people are bad, I propose all humans have the capability to do horrible things when pushed to the edge. The threshold for which causes someone to reach a genocidal level of anger and fear is entirely dependent on the person. For a whole country to reach this level there are major steps that must be taken. These can be broken down, very basically, into a few stages.</p>
								<p>CGP Grey highlights the steps to ruling a country as, to keep key supporters on your side, control the countries resources, and to minimize key supporters. To elaborate, the idea is to keep the people needed to run the country close to you, while trimming away the people not needed. Once the select few are decided on, the best way to keep them loyal is to pay them well. Your supporters help control the countries money and resources, allowing you to maintain control. The issue comes when the country becomes too poor for the ruler to pay his supporters, or when the people revolt because of living conditions.</p>
