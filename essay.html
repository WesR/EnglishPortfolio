								<h1>What Leads to Genocide?</h1>
								<p>&emsp;&emsp;Genocide is a touchy subject. In society, most countries and societies are willing to recognize what has passed, but some are still in denial of the most widely known and factually supported genocides, like the Holocaust, or Armenian. Putting aside the fact that some countries outright deny the mere existence of genocide whether committed by them or not, we are left with countries that gloss over the in-depth facts of this horrible atrocity. To better understand what makes a genocide happen, to understand what drives a people to kill of their neighbor, we must look deeper into what has happened before us. By understanding what leads people to committing these crimes, we can prevent genocide from happening before it even becomes a threat.</p>
								<p>&emsp;&emsp;Even though not all people are bad, I propose all humans have the capability to do horrible things when pushed to the edge. The threshold for which causes someone to reach a genocidal level of anger and fear is entirely dependent on the person. For a whole country to reach this level there are major steps that must be taken. These can be broken down, very basically, into a few stages.</p>
								<p>&emsp;&emsp;CGP Grey highlights the steps to ruling a country as, to keep key supporters on your side, control the countries resources, and to minimize key supporters. To elaborate, the idea is to keep the people needed to run the country close to you, while trimming away the people not needed. Once the select few are decided on, the best way to keep them loyal is to pay them well. Your supporters help control the countries money and resources, allowing you to maintain control. The issue comes when the country becomes too poor for the ruler to pay his supporters, or when the people revolt because of living conditions.</p>
								<p>&emsp;&emsp;This is the time of revolutions; when a government fights for control, or is destroyed by the next thing willing to take its place. Here is where we usually see a government using all the tools they have at their disposal, genocide being one of the more desperate measures. A modern-day example of genocide used as a tool would be current North Korea. The only people living well in that society are the governmental elite. The Kim family make sure that their supporters are well compensated, and in turn they keep everyone under them in check. This includes the use of death camps.</p>
								<p>&emsp;&emsp;Economic failure has been a reoccurring theme in pre-genocidal regimes. Germany had the post WWI reparations, which caused wide spread devaluation of money. The country’s economic state became so bad that the exchange rate rose to 4,200,000,000,000 marks per dollar by the end of 1923. (Rare, 1) It became more economic to use the paper cash as firewood or children’s toys, than to buy a loaf a bread. Economic collapse like this is extreme, but not isolated to just post war Germany. During the Armenian genocide, the bankrupt Ottoman Empire was facing ruin. The empire declared the killings of Armenians legal, and whoever being the killer received 95% of the deceased’s wealth. The latter 5% would be taken by the government. (Ghazanchyan, 1) The pre-genocidal economic state of the Ottoman Empire was largely a factor that instigated the killings.</p>
