								<p>&emsp;&emsp;Like I said in my proposal, the goal of my paper was to find out how to predict when a genocide might occur. The best counter measure against genocide is making sure it does not happen in the first place. This is why I chose this topic. </p>
								<p>&emsp;&emsp;Every country is different. Because of this my steps needed to be broad, but not so broad as to falsely categorize a country’s future. Because of this I decided to focus on a few things. I decided to look at economic conditions because of how intertwined it is with a countries people. The world is driven by money, and by looking at how a country is doing economically I was able to find connections between a people’s current emotions, feelings of the future, and desperation. </p>
								<p>&emsp;&emsp;Other aspects were easier to pick out, like mandated markings, or focused blame. With my research, I tried to organize it in such a way that things proceeded in chronological order. I hope that this makes it easier for someone to judge where a country is on the path to genocide. It is very well possible for earlier things, like mass prejudice, to eventually lead to nothing. This is why I decided to mark a point where I said countries have a choice to decide if they should go “all in”.  </p>
								<p>&emsp;&emsp;This essay was enjoyable to me, even though it was such a gloomy topic, because I see it as a world of possibilities. My research has shown me hope. Now, knowing what goes into a genocide I feel humanity becomes more aware of what is happening around them and how their feelings are being twisted. My hope is that this realization will keep people aware of what is happening in the world around them, because genocide can only happen if a society allows it. </p>
