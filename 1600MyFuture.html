							<p>This is a writing I had to do for my computing professionals class. In summary it is a simple plan for my future. It includes both short and long term goals.</p>
							<div><div><div>
							<p>&emsp;&emsp;In my career in Computer Science, I want to become successful enough to support my family, I want to enjoy my job, and I want to be able to make a change in the world. These are long term goals, they are things that I will eventually do if I strive to achieve them. Short term, I want to pass all my classes, learn more about information security, and get an internship. Achieving these short-term goals will pave the path to help me achieve my final long term goals.</p>
							<p>&emsp;&emsp;To do good in my classes I need to strive to get all my work done on time, and I need to comprehend the subject. If I do not understand what to do, I need to seek help. This could be me asking a friend who is in the same class for a tutorial, or meeting with someone in one of the counseling centers. If I have a hard time in the specific subject, I can decide to schedule a weekly session in the counseling center. Succeeding here will help me get my foot in the door for an internship, because showing that I can manage grade shows responsibility. </p>
							<p>&emsp;&emsp;In addition to learning all I can in class, I believe it is important to learn more if I want to succeeded in my internship. Everyone comes in the door with very similar knowledge, because we all took very similar classes in college. By practicing information security outside of class, I gain knowledge that will put me the step above the rest. Certifications are a good way to show these skills, I already have my Security+ certification from Certiport. These both show that I have “Textbook smarts” in the security field. To learn field work more I joined the 49th Security Division, and have bought hardware myself, like my Cisco Catalyst 2950. The 49th puts on talks and participates in capture the flag events, to further help me sharpen my skills. The club will teach me the techniques that a security consultant uses when writing up reports, penetration testing, and defending their systems. By becoming familiar with these techniques, I can integrate myself into the work environment better. Hopefully with the skills learned here, I will impress the company enough for them to hire me.</p>
							<p>&emsp;&emsp;Before getting an internship, I need to apply for one. To do this I will need to rebuild my High school resume to reflect my current certifications and qualifications. For the interview, I need to present myself as calm and collected. It is important to have a firm handshake, look the interviewer in the eyes, and stand up straight. I will be myself in the interview, and hope for the best. If I do not get the first internship, it is not a problem.  There are many more out there that would also be a good fit for me. After getting my internship, it will be important to dress well, be on time, and go above and beyond in what I am asked. Connections are important, meeting and talking to people should be one of my priorities. These connections will be important in helping me get a job in the future.</p>
							<p>&emsp;&emsp;Hopefully my internship will spawn a job, if it does not, it is another thing I can put on my resume. Throughout the rest of college, I need to continue doing well in my classes, learning as much as I can outside of class, and getting more internships. These will all make me more marketable in the job world. By doing all of these things I will be in a good position to achieve my long-term goals. </p>
							<p>&emsp;&emsp;After getting out of college and into the workforce I will tackle my long-term goals. To do this there are some things I need to do. I need to manage my time well, I do not want work life consume me and take away valuable time from me and my family. This is currently one of my weaker areas. I need to planning out what I do, and become more organized. This will increase my productivity, and intern make work more enjoyable. By staying productive, I help secure my job in the future.</p>
							<p>&emsp;&emsp;My final goal is to change the world, leaving behind me somewhere better then what I started with. This can be done in many ways, by invention or innovation, by a discovery, or even in smaller ways such as talking to people who seem down, or going out of my way to help someone. I know that as long as I strive to do good in everything I do, to put in the effort required to do quality work, and to stay curious and keep learning, I will achieve my goals.</p>
