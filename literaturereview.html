														<td>The 8 Stages of Genocide by Gregory H. Stanton</td>
														<td>Steps that help a countries people be fine with genocide.</td>
														<td>This passage talks about the steps taken when a genocide is carried out. People are classified, then are marked. The marked group is then dehumanized. Organization is needed, whether it be government wide or small local groups, these groups then help polarize society; there can be no moderates. The leaders then prepare, they create maps or force identification, this leads to the extermination, this is the mass killings of the people. After the Genocide, has ended, the government then tries to hide what happened, entering the last stage of denial. </td>

														<td>The Ten Stages of Genocide by Dr. Gregory Stanton</td>
														<td>Steps that help a countries people be fine with genocide.</td>
														<td>This is like the last paper. The difference being the steps that can be taken to prevent genocide, and that preparation and persecution are expanded upon, given their own category. In preparation, the National group leaders plan their version of “The final solution”, here they obtain the required supplies they need. In persecution, the group is separate out from the rest.</td>

														<td>10 Reasons Countries Fall Apart by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson</td>
														<td>Economic failure creates desperation. This is how economic failure happens.</td>
														<td>We find the economic collapse of a country to happen when the current government in power decides to focus too much on personal gains, instead of running the country. Other times they can suffer from a weak government that just doesn’t have the resources or will to effectively rule the country. This is a dangerous thing, people act out, revolutions start, this extractive atmosphere only temporarily help those who are in power.</td>

														<td>3 Rules for Rulers by CGP Grey</td>
														<td>What does a leader have to control, and why do we get revolutions?</td>
														<td>To control a country, you need to control the people under you, intern controlling the people. This is done through funds. Deciding where to allocate this money is where a ruler has problems. They need to buy loyalty, because who they buy is who gives them power. By allocating too much money to your key supporters, you lose money you allocate to the people. This causes unrest and breeds revolution. Rule1: keep key supporters on your side. Rule 2: control the treasure. Rule 3: Minimize key supporters. “We live in a world where the best smartest democracies are stable, and the worst richest dictatorships are stable, and in between is a valley of revolution.” Countries fall because they lose money.</td>

														<td>Background Information on Preventing Genocide</td>
														<td>Other leading factors to genocide: armed conflict.</td>
														<td>Genocide requires organization. Armed conflict is usually a catalyst for genocide. The power of misinformation or hidden information is usually used by the perpetrating country. The best way to prevent genocide is to prevent armed conflict, protect civilians, and gather information on the countries current events.</td>

														<td>How did Hitler rise to power? by Ted-ed</td>
														<td>Why do people accept a rule that commits such atrocities?</td>
														<td>The economic sanctions and post ww1 turmoil of Germany left many people trying to blame someone. Because people were already hasty to point fingers, it was easy to re direct this anger towards Jews. The things people did were because of fear and anger. Hitler offered convenient scape goats, while other parties floundered in handling the countries unrest. After gaining a position of power, he took current events to restrict the press and other parties.</td>

														<td>Armenian Genocide by History.com</td>
														<td>What caused the Armenian genocide?</td>
														<td>Before the genocide, the ottoman empire was crumbling. The border between the empire and Russia was unstable. During this time the country was anxious, this along with the pre-conceived thought that the Christian Armenians were not loyal to the Muslim government (But the neighboring Russia) lead to harsh treatment of them. The Armenians protested, causing government officials to take actions and solve the “Armenian question”. </td>

													<tr>
														<td>Rwanda: How the genocide happened by the BBC</td>
														<td>The spark that initiates the genocide.</td>
														<td>The spark that caused the genocide was the shooting down of the Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu. A French judge blamed the current Rwandan President, Paul Kagame who was the leader of a Tutsi rebel group, for the attack. Within hours of the news breaking of the ruling, the attacks on Tutsi started. The tensions that built up before the spark were what caused the actions after. The country was in a poor economic state, coupled with the hatred the larger Hutu population harbored towards the European favored and more successful Tutsi set the stage for what happened. </td>
